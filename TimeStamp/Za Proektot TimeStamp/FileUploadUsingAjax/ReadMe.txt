There are two files in project folder.

1. Index.cshtml - It is design of HTML where upload control and javascript is there.
2. HomeController.cs - It contains method called UploadFiles() which helps to upload files.

In order to implement this, create a new mvc project in Visual Studio. Then copy Index.cshtml file and put it in View foler.
Next copy HomeController.cs file to Controller folder.
